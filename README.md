Funtionality 

GIVEN a note-taking application, WHEN I open the Note Taker, THEN I am presented with a landing page featuring a link to a notes page.

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page, THEN I am directed to a page displaying existing notes in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

!Unless you click on "New Note", note title and note's text are disabled! , once you click on "New Note" then, I can enter a new note title and the note’s text, THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

WHEN I click on the "Save Note" button, THEN the new note I have entered is saved, appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes, and the buttons in the navigation bar disappear.

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation bar.

WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation bar at the top of the page, THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column, and the "New Note" button disappears.

If both title and text are empty, you can not save the notes. both fields can not have null values.
